THE "DO WHAT YOU WANT" LICENSE
Version 42.0.1, March 2025

Copyright (c) 2025 benbenbang and his army of keyboard-tapping hamsters

Everyone is permitted to copy, distribute, modify, merge, sell, publish,
sublicense, fold into origami, use as a pizza topping, or do literally
anything else with this software and associated documentation files
(the "Stuff"), subject to the following hilarious conditions:

1. THE STUFF IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.
   If it breaks your computer, turns your code into spaghetti, or
   summons ancient Python debugging demons, that's totally on you.

2. You MUST tell at least one bad programming joke when sharing this
   software with others. Examples include:
   - "Why do Python programmers wear glasses? Because they can't C."
   - "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks,
     'Can I join you?'"

3. If this software makes your life easier, you are morally but not
   legally obligated to send the author virtual high-fives, pictures
   of cute animals, or recommend a good TV show to watch.

4. This license may not actually be legally binding in any jurisdiction,
   because, let's be honest, the author is not a lawyer and wrote this
   while procrastinating on actual work.

5. By using this software, you agree that virtual environments are superior
   to global installations and anyone who says otherwise is objectively wrong.

IN SUMMARY: Have fun, don't be a jerk, and remember that Python is
indentation-sensitive, just like the author when people don't use spaces
for indentation.

DISCLAIMER: The author wrote this license on insufficient caffeine and
cannot be held responsible for any humor attempted herein.
